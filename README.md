🚲 Currently Working On: Bike Rental System – Looking for Collaborators

I’m actively developing a **Bike Rental System** where users can search, book, and manage bikes for rental in a smooth and secure way. This project focuses on building a real-world, scalable solution using modern backend technologies.

🔧 Current Progress:
✅ Backend APIs completed  
✅ Vehicle approval & admin control implemented  
✅ Secure authentication & authorization  
✅ Booking logic in progress  
✅ PostgreSQL integration  

💻 Tech Stack:
• Backend – Spring Boot  
• Database – PostgreSQL  
• Security – JWT / Role-based access  
• Frontend – React (In progress)  

Here is the **backend code of my project**:

🎨 UI/UX Designers  
🧠 Anyone interested in system design or testing

Let’s build something impactful 🚀
